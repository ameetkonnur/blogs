## About
This blog is a minimalist blog about building solutions on Azure addressing some paint points / requirements. Its structured in a way to tell you WHAT a particular solution aims to acheive, the WHY & the HOW. It will also contain reference source code being used to develop this solution. The blog will not go into detail (concepts / fundamentals) of every technology / platform being used but will only have working steps on getting something done. It assumes some familiarity with coding, scripting & Azure.

Enjoy!
