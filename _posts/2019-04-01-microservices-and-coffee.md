## microservices

microservices is one of the latest buzzwords that everybody hears from the other, the other claims to have done many times over but yet its hard for them to explain what it is. when i work with my customer's and try and explain it to them, it sounds very difficult for them to understand what it is and why it's required.  so i thought about it a lot on how best to make it relatable with something that we see everyday and try it explain it that way. actually the more i think about it, largely all computer technology
