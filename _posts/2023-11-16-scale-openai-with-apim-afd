title: Scaling Azure OpenAI with Azure API Management and Azure Front Door
---

## Introduction

This guide is designed to provide a detailed and insightful approach for scaling Azure OpenAI services using Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Front Door, focusing on key decision-making aspects to help users understand the strategy behind the process.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure account with the necessary privileges.
- A basic understanding of Azure services and the Azure portal.

## Detailed Procedure with Decision Points

### Step 1: Creation of Azure API Management Instance

#### Action
- Initiate the process by creating a new APIM instance in the Azure portal.

#### Tier Selection
- Choose a tier based on your performance and scalability requirements, considering factors like expected traffic and feature needs.

#### Decision Rationale
- APIM is critical for managing API traffic, crucial for controlling and monitoring Azure OpenAI services usage.

#### Reference
- [Azure API Management documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/)

### Step 2: Importing Azure OpenAI API Reference

#### Action
- Import the Azure OpenAI API reference using the OpenAPI specification.

#### Issue Resolution
- In case of an invalid Web Service URL error, manually adjust the Server URL to ensure proper integration.

#### Decision Rationale
- Using OpenAPI specifications standardizes and simplifies the API integration process.

#### Reference
- Azure OpenAI OpenAPI Specification: [Azure OpenAI OpenAPI specification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)

### Step 3: Configuring Managed Identity and Role Assignments

#### Action
- Configure the Managed Identity for the APIM instance.

#### Role Assignment
- Assign the “Cognitive Services Azure OpenAI User” role appropriately.

#### Decision Rationale
- Managed Identities enhance security and automate access management, crucial for maintaining secure access to Azure OpenAI services.

#### Reference
- [Managed Identity documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/)

### Step 4: Defining Inbound Policies in API Management

#### Action
- Implement an Inbound Policy to enable Managed Identity for backend connections.

#### Policy Configuration
- This ensures secure communication between APIM and Azure OpenAI.

#### Decision Rationale
- Inbound policies are key for handling requests securely and efficiently.

#### Reference
- [Azure API Management policies documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-policies)

### Step 5: Access Management with Products & Subscriptions

#### Action
- Utilize APIM's Products & Subscriptions for user access management.

#### Configuration Aspects
- Manage Authentication, Logging, and Throughput via APIM policies.

#### Decision Rationale
- This step is essential for scaling user access management in a controlled and efficient manner.

#### Reference
- [APIM Subscriptions documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-subscriptions)

### Step 6: Implementing Azure Front Door for Scalability

#### Action
- Use Azure Front Door for load balancing across multiple Azure OpenAI instances.

#### Configuration Steps
  - Set up Azure Front Door to balance traffic among Azure OpenAI instances.

#### Decision Rationale
- Azure Front Door offers advanced routing and load balancing capabilities, essential for high traffic scenarios and service availability.

#### Key Management
- Managed Identities simplify key management significantly.

#### Consistency in Deployment IDs
- Maintaining consistent Deployment IDs across instances streamlines management.

#### Reference
- [Azure Front Door documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)

## Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of scaling Azure OpenAI using APIM and Azure Front Door. It offers strategic insights beyond procedural steps, enhancing the effectiveness of the setup.
