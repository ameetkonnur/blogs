title: Minimalist Guide for Setting Up Azure API Management, Azure Front Door with Azure OpenAI
---
## 1. Creating an APIM Instance
Start by creating an Azure API Management (APIM) instance. You can select any tier that suits your requirements.

## 2. Importing Azure OpenAI API Reference
Download and Modify the Open API Specification: Obtain the Open API specification from Azure. You'll need to edit the JSON file to hardcode your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL. This step fixes the error of an invalid Web Service URL during import.

## 3. Configuring the APIM URL
Add a Suffix: After importing the OpenAI API reference, append a suffix, such as 'openai', to the base URL of your APIM. This adjustment is necessary for compatibility with existing OpenAI SDKs that use Azure OpenAI endpoints.

## 4. Setting Up Managed Identity
Find and Assign Roles to APIM Managed Identity: Identify the APIM Managed Identity and assign it the “Cognitive Services OpenAI User” role. This can be done at the level of the Azure OpenAI resource, the Resource Group, or the Subscription, depending on your preferred scope of control.

## 5. Implementing Inbound Policy
Add an Inbound Policy in APIM: In the API definitions of APIM, insert an inbound policy. This policy should enable APIM to use its Managed Identity for connecting to Azure OpenAI. The policy might resemble:
<authentication-managed-identity resource="https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/" />

## 6. Testing the APIM API Endpoint
Verify Functionality: Ensure the new policy and API definitions are working correctly by testing the APIM API endpoint.

## 7. Managing Access and Control
Utilize APIM Products & Subscriptions: Use APIM’s features like Products & Subscriptions to manage user access. Set policies regarding authentication, logging, and throughput.

## 8. Handling Increased Load
Scaling with Multiple Azure OpenAI Instances: As user demand increases, additional Azure OpenAI instances may be required. Although APIM isn’t designed as a load balancer, you can use custom scripts in policies as a temporary solution. However, this method is not ideal for long-term scalability.

## 9. Integrating Azure Front Door for Load Balancing
Set Up Azure Front Door: Implement Azure Front Door to manage traffic between multiple Azure OpenAI instances.
Configure APIM with Azure Front Door as the Backend: Set up the route like `https://<your-front-door-name>.<some-random-string>.z01.fd.net`.
Configure Origin Group in Azure Front Door: In the Origin Group settings of Azure Front Door, add the Azure OpenAI endpoints, such as `https://<AOAI-Instance-01.openai.azure.com>` and `https://<AOAI-Instance-02.openai.azure.com>`.

## 10. Streamlining Access Management
Access with Managed Identities: Ensure the APIM Managed Identity has access to all Azure OpenAI instances. This setup simplifies the management of access keys.

## 11. Ensuring Consistency in Deployment IDs
Maintain Identical Deployment IDs: It's important that all Azure OpenAI instances have deployments with the same name to ensure consistency in the Deployment IDs used in Azure OpenAI calls.

This structured approach helps in setting up and managing Azure APIM with Azure OpenAI, ensuring scalability, efficient load management, and streamlined access control. Regularly reviewing and updating these configurations is essential to keep up with evolving demands and Azure service updates.

## Conclusion
This minimalist guide mentions the setup and management of Azure API Management integrated with Azure OpenAI, focusing on aspects like security, scalability, and efficient load management. Each step includes reasoning to understand the importance and impact of the actions taken.
