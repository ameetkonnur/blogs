title: azure usage & cost management reports with budgets & alerts
---

## what

As one starts using Azure, Governance & Billing are two important aspects that overwhelm most customers. While one can take proactive measures to ensure certain policies and process is put around, over time these dont seem enough as quickly there is sprawl of resources. Often too much control comes at a cost of agility and innovation. To keep a balance, you need to be less controlling but  keep a tab on how resources are being deployed and how much does it cost. Currently Azure Portal doesnt give an integrated view of all resources & their costs in a simple and easy way. This project attempts to address that with a few features like self service BI, cost budgets and email alerts.
